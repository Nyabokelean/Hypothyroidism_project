# Hypothyroidism_project
(by Lean Nyakundi)

> Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. 
> As a Data Scientist, I have been asked to use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:  

>> * Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid

## Context
Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is not able to produce enough thyroid hormone. 
Since the main purpose of thyroid hormone is to "run the body's metabolism," it is understandable that 
people with this condition will have symptoms associated with a slow metabolism.

Nairobi Hospital would like to build a model which can assist them accurately predict whether someone 
has Hypothyroid or not.

## Experimental Design

The design for this project will include:

* Perform your EDA
* Perform any necessary feature engineering
* Check of multicollinearity
* Decision trees
* Random Forest
* Ada boostedtrees
* Gradient boosted trees
* SVM(Support Vector Machine)
* Polynimial Kernel
* Sigmoid Kernel
* Radial Basis Function(rbf)
* Cross-validate the model
* Coupute accuracy score

## Resources
1. Python Libraries(Pandas, Numpy,Matplotlib, Sklearn)
2. Google Collaboratory
